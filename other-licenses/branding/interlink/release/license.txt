DURING THE PRODUCT'S INSTALLATION PROCESS, AND AT LATER TIMES, YOU MAY BE GIVEN THE OPTION OF INSTALLING ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS FROM THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE PROVIDERS. THE INSTALLATION AND USE OF THOSE THIRD-PARTY COMPONENTS MAY BE GOVERNED BY ADDITIONAL LICENSE AGREEMENTS.

1. LICENSE GRANT.
Binary Outcast grants you a non-exclusive license to use the executable code version of the Product. This Agreement will also govern any software upgrades provided by Binary Outcast that replace and/or supplement the original Product, unless such upgrades are accompanied by a separate license, in which case the terms of that license will govern.

If you breach this Agreement, your right to use the Product will terminate immediately and without notice, but all provisions of this Agreement except the License Grant (Paragraph 1 and 4) will survive termination and continue to be in effect. Upon termination, you must destroy all copies of the Product.

3. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS.
Portions of the Product are available in source code form under the terms of the Mozilla Public License 2.0 and other open source licenses (collectively, "Open Source Licenses").

(a) Binary Outcast grants you permission to distribute executable code versions of the Product providing they are UNALTERED or otherwise identical to those provided by Binary Outcast itself.
(b) In the case of open source operating systems building executable code versions from source, express permission must be obtained from Binary Outcast before any such executable code version containing intellectual property may be distributed through any medium.
